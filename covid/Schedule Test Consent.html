        <a> Consent Form - Tartan Test</a>
        <br><br>
        <p1>
        I authorize Carnegie Mellon University's (CMU's) Tartan Testing Laboratory (the<br> "Laboratory") to conduct collection and testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (COVID-19) <br>through the collection of a saliva specimen from me. I understand that my submission<br> of a specimen for testing is entirely voluntary, but if I choose to participate <br>in on-campus or CMU-related activities, including in-person instruction/teaching,<br> academic study, staff duties, vendor/contractor duties (e.g., janitorial and <br>foodservice, professional services), research and campus life, etc., it is expected <br>that I undergo testing for COVID-19. <br>

        I acknowledge that the physician who ordered a COVID-19 test pursuant to this <br>Consent Form is NOT my treating physician or primary care provider and the act of <br>ordering this test as part of the University's COVID-19 testing program does not <br>establish a physician-patient relationship between the ordering physician and <br>myself. If I receive from the Laboratory a suggestion that I may wish to consider <br>additional medical attention or treatment, or if I determine that I wish to seek <br>additional medical attention or treatment related to a potential case of COVID-19 <br>or otherwise, <br>

        I acknowledge that I must follow up with my regular treating health care provider to<br> discuss the next steps in my care. I assume complete and full responsibility to <br>take appropriate action with regard to my test results. I agree to seek medical <br>advice, care and treatment from my primary health care provider or other <br>healthcare professionals if I have questions or concerns, or if my condition <br>worsens. The ordering physician is not responsible or liable for any course of <br>treatment, diagnosis, or any other health care service I may elect to receive as a <br>result of receiving this test or otherwise.  </p1>
